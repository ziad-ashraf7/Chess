## About
- This is a GUI chess game mainly made by JavaFX.
- The game is 2 players using the same machine, with interactive design and pieces.
- Designed the game structure using OOP pillars, and SOLID principles to improve the code design.
- Implemented checkmate detection and interactive chessboard where piece movements illuminate upon mouse
  interaction (not resulting in checkmate), utilizing JavaFX built-in functions.
- This game was made mainly to master the OOP Pillars and some SOLID principles for self-education.
- I used Piece `abstract Class` to serve the Abstration pillar by making `abstract methodes` and let every different piece implement its own logic.
  **You can try the game by Cloning the Repo, Running the main method, and Enjoy :)**
